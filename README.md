# Portfolio Website

This website was made so i can practice my HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. The design is not mine, it was taken from [Kryston Schwarze](https://krystonschwarze.com/).
I just tried my best to copy his website to understand the workflow. I have made some changes, for example i have added a light/dark mode toggle.

You can view the live [website](https://alikhassanov.github.io/portfolio_website/) here.
